## Quick Example

```python
from marcus_mcp import MarcusClient

# Agent registers and enters work loop
client = MarcusClient()
await client.register_agent(agent_id="worker-1", capabilities=["python", "react"])

while True:
    # Request optimal task
    task = await client.request_next_task("worker-1")

    if task:
        # Get rich context
        context = await client.get_task_context(task['id'])

        # Work autonomously
        result = await do_work(task, context)

        # Report completion
        await client.report_task_progress(task['id'], "worker-1", 100, result)
```

## Core Features

### Natural Language Project Creation
Describe your project in plain English - Marcus transforms it into structured tasks with intelligent dependencies.

### Context-Rich Task Assignment
Every task includes implementation context, dependency analysis, architectural decisions, and risk assessment.

### AI-Powered Intelligence
Hybrid system combining rules for safety, AI for intelligence, and fallbacks for reliability.

### Multi-Tier Memory
Working, Episodic, Semantic, and Procedural memory enables continuous learning and improvement.

### Predictive Analytics
Completion forecasts, blockage probability, cascade impact analysis, and resource optimization.

### Comprehensive Coordination
Assignment leases, orphan recovery, health monitoring, and automatic synchronization.

## Philosophy

> **Focus on what you control** - Task structure, context, dependencies
>
> **Accept what you cannot** - How agents choose to solve problems
>
> **Learn from what emerges** - Pattern recognition and continuous improvement
>
> **Practice transparency** - All actions visible, all decisions logged

Marcus doesn't try to control everything. It creates the conditions for success and lets intelligence emerge.
